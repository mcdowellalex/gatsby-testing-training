Used yarn 
node v16

followed this guide: https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/testing/unit-testing/ 

I like the convention of using a tests folder rather than putting the tests next to the file in the components folder.



1. snapshot testing with jest -> header.js
2. react component testing -> title.js
3. graphql -> index.js
4. css in js -> button.js and wrapper.js
